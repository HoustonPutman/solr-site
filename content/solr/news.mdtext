## 24 August 2015 - Apache Solr 5.3.0 and Reference Guide for 5.3 available

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic
clustering, database integration, rich document (e.g., Word, PDF)
handling, and geospatial search.  Solr is highly scalable, providing
fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers the search
and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 5.3.0 is available for immediate download at:
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

Solr 5.3 Release Highlights:

 * In addition to many other improvements in the security framework, Solr now includes an AuthenticationPlugin implementing HTTP Basic Auth that stores credentials securely in ZooKeeper. This is a simple way to require a username and password for anyone accessing Solrâ€™s admin screen or APIs.
 * In built AuthorizationPlugin that provides fine grained control over implementing ACLs for various resources with permisssion rules which are stored in ZooKeeper.
 * The JSON Facet API can now change the domain for facet commands, essentially doing a block join and moving from parents to children, or children to parents before calculating the facet data.
 * Major improvements in performance of the new Facet Module / JSON Facet API.
 * Query and Range Facets under Pivot Facets. Just like the JSON Facet API, pivot facets can how nest other facet types such as range and query facets.
 * More Like This Query Parser options. The MoreLikeThis QParser now supports all options provided by the MLT Handler. The query parser is much more versatile than the handler as it works in cloud mode as well as anywhere a normal query can be specified.
 * Added Schema API support in SolrJ
 * Added Scoring mode for query-time join and block join.
 * Added Smile response format

## 18 August 2014 - Recommendation to update Apache POI in Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, and 4.9.0 installations

Apache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball.
This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:

### CVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Information disclosure:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...).
Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass
security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction
with an entity reference.

### CVE-2014-3574: XML Entity Expansion (XEE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Denial of service:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components and Apache Xmlbeans to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products
(DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks ("XML bombs"),
which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.

**The Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.**

Solr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the "Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)"
contrib module from the folder "contrib/extraction" of the release tarball.

Users of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it.
Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by
replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have
to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.

### To replace the vulnerable JAR files follow these steps:

* Download the [Apache POI 3.10.1](http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.10.1) binary release.

* Unzip the archive.

* Delete the following files in your "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder: 
    * poi-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-ooxml-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-scratchpad-3.10-beta2.jar
    * xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar
  
* Copy the following files from the base folder of the Apache POI distribution to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder: 
    * poi-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-scratchpad-3.10.1-20140818.jar

* Copy "xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar" from POI's "ooxml-lib/" folder to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder.

* Verify that the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" no longer contains any files with version number "3.10-beta2".

* Verify that the folder contains one xmlbeans JAR file with version 2.6.0.

If you just want to disable extraction of Microsoft Office documents, delete the files above and don't replace them.
"Solr Cell" will automatically detect this and disable Microsoft Office document extraction.

Coming versions of Apache Solr will have the updated libraries bundled.

  Oracle Java 7 or OpenJDK 7, minimum update 55; earlier versions
  have known JVM bugs affecting Solr).

* Apache Solr is fully compatible with Java 8.

* <code class="inline">&lt;fields&gt;</code> and <code class="inline">&lt;types&gt;</code> tags have been deprecated from schema.xml.
  There is no longer any reason to keep them in the schema file,
  they may be safely removed. This allows intermixing of <code class="inline">&lt;fieldType&gt;</code>,
  <code class="inline">&lt;field&gt;</code> and <code class="inline">&lt;copyField&gt;</code> definitions if desired.

* The new \{!complexphrase\} query parser supports wildcards, ORs etc.
  inside Phrase Queries. 

* New Collections API CLUSTERSTATUS action reports the status of
  collections, shards, and replicas, and also lists collection
  aliases and cluster properties.
 
* Added managed synonym and stopword filter factories, which enable
  synonym and stopword lists to be dynamically managed via REST API.

* JSON updates now support nested child documents, enabling \{!child\}
  and \{!parent\} block join queries. 

* Added ExpandComponent to expand results collapsed by the
  CollapsingQParserPlugin, as well as the parent/child relationship
  of nested child documents.

* Long-running Collections API tasks can now be executed
  asynchronously; the new REQUESTSTATUS action provides status.

* Added a hl.qparser parameter to allow you to define a query parser
  for hl.q highlight queries.

* In Solr single-node mode, cores can now be created using named
  configsets.

* New DocExpirationUpdateProcessorFactory supports computing an
  expiration date for documents from the "TTL" expression, as well as
  automatically deleting expired documents on a periodic basis. 

Solr 4.8.0 also includes many other new features as well as numerous
optimizations and bugfixes of the corresponding
[Apache Lucene](/core/4_8_0/) release.

## 12 March 2014 - Apache Solr 4.8 will require Java 7

The Apache Solr committers decided with a large majority on the vote to require **Java 7** for the next minor release of Apache Solr (version 4.8)!

The next release will also contain some improvements for Java 7:

* Better file handling (especially on Windows) in the directory implementations. Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).

* Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM.

If you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7.
Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.
The recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption.
Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.
In addition, there is no more Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7.
JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue.
Please also review our list of JVM bugs: <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs>

*EDIT (as of 15 April 2014):* The recently released Java 7u55 fixes the above bug causing index corrumption.
This version is now the recommended version for running Apache Solr.

## 5 March 2014 - Apache Solr Ref Guide for 4.7 Available
The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce that there is a new version of the Solr Reference Guide available for Solr 4.7.

The 395 page PDF serves as the definitive user's manual for Solr 4.7. It can be downloaded from the Apache mirror network:
