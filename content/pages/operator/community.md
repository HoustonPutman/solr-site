## Support ##

The Solr Operator community provides user support for free through the [users mailing list](#mailing-lists-chat) and [slack channels](#slack).

## Mailing Lists & Chat ##

We use [mailing lists](https://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html) for all official project communications.
To subscribe or unsubscribe you need to send an email to special addresses (e.g. users-subscribe@solr.apache.org to subscribe to the users list).
This email must be sent from **the email address you want to subscribe as or unsubscribe from**. You will then need to
confirm by replying to an automated e-mail from the list software.

The Solr Operator shares mailing lists with its parent project, Apache Solr.
Available lists can be [found here]({filename}/pages/community.md#mailing-lists-chat).

#### Mailing list etiquette

Written communication is hard and prone to misunderstandings. We recommend reading [ComDev's etiquette page](https://community.apache.org/contributors/etiquette) for some practical tips on how to improve.

#### Slack ####

* The project's main Slack channel is `#solr-operator` in the `Kubernetes` organization.  
  Link: <https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/solr-operator>

* A developer focused Slack channel can be found at `#solr-operator` in the `the-asf` organization.  
  Link: <https://the-asf.slack.com/messages/C01JR8WE1M5>

## Code of Conduct ##

For a large and diverse community like ours to be friendly, welcoming and respectful, we recognize the need for some guidelines. The project follows [Apache's Code of Conduct statement](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct). Please take some time to read and understand it.

If you feel there has been a violation of this code, please point out your concerns publicly in a friendly and matter of fact manner. Nonverbal communication is prone to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. Everyone has bad days and sometimes says things they regret later. Someone else's communication style may clash with yours, but the difference can be amicably resolved. After pointing out your concerns please be generous upon receiving an apology.

Should there be repeated instances of code of conduct violations, or if there is an obvious and severe violation, the Solr PMC may become involved.

### The Apache Way

As an Apache project we strive to follow [The Apache Way](http://theapacheway.com/). If you are new to the community or to open source in general, you may benefit from understanding our core values as a community, and why we operate the way we do.

## Version Control ##

The Solr source code resides in the Apache [GIT](http://git.apache.org) repository. Various GIT clients
can be obtained from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). There are also GIT integrations for various
IDEs. For Eclipse, look at [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/). IntelliJ has git support bundled, if you
have installed the command line version.

#### Web Access (read-only) ####

The source code can be browsed at <https://github.com/apache/solr-operator> and also <https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=solr-operator.git>.
No GIT client software is required.

#### Cloning the repository ####

To work on the code locally, you may clone the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/apache/solr-operator.git

Then use GitHub's [fork feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
to obtain a personal fork from which you can later contribute your changes through a
[Pull Request](https://github.com/apache/solr-operator/pulls)

You may alternatively choose to clone apache's git mirror at `https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=solr-operator.git`.
